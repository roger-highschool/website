            <p>My name is Lezeth Lua but I prefer to be called Z. I am currently studying Multimedia Arts at De La Salle - College of Saint Benilde. I chose MMA because I want to pursue a career in fashion photography as well as venture into various digital mediums of art which I am able to through this program. I also want to explore other forms of art that I can make a career out of  besides photography.</p>
